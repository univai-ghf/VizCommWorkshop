# VizCommWorkshop

Not long ago, the ability to create smart data visualizations (or dataviz) was a nice-to-have skill for design- and data-minded managers. But now it’s a must-have skill for all managers, because it’s often the only way to make sense of the work they do.

Whether you are pitching a new idea, persuading others to take action, building a strategy, or making a decision, data is key. But the amount of information available today is staggering. Data is being recorded with such overwhelming velocity, and in such volume, that some level of abstraction is crucial, otherwise it is easy to become overwhelmed by too many statistics, distracted by the wrong set of numbers, and confused by the complexity of data.

Thanks to the internet and a growing number of affordable tools, visualization is accessible for everyone—but that convenience can lead to charts that are merely adequate or even ineffective.

Through this workshop we will learn how to tell data stories with visualizations and we will focus on few key data viz aspects that will help us communicate more precisely by pinpointing the most relevant information.
